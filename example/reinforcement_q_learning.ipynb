    "This tutorial shows how to use PyTorch to train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent\n",
    "on the CartPole-v0 task from the `OpenAI Gym <https://gym.openai.com/>`__.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task**\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent has to decide between two actions - moving the cart left or\n",
    "right - so that the pole attached to it stays upright. You can find an\n",
    "official leaderboard with various algorithms and visualizations at the\n",
    "`Gym website <https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v0>`__.\n",

    "   cartpole\n",
    "\n",
    "As the agent observes the current state of the environment and chooses\n",
    "an action, the environment *transitions* to a new state, and also\n",
    "returns a reward that indicates the consequences of the action. In this\n",
    "task, rewards are +1 for every incremental timestep and the environment\n",
    "terminates if the pole falls over too far or the cart moves more then 2.4\n",
    "units away from center. This means better performing scenarios will run\n",
    "for longer duration, accumulating larger return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CartPole task is designed so that the inputs to the agent are 4 real\n",
    "values representing the environment state (position, velocity, etc.).\n",
    "However, neural networks can solve the task purely by looking at the\n",
    "scene, so we'll use a patch of the screen centered on the cart as an\n",
    "input. Because of this, our results aren't directly comparable to the\n",
    "ones from the official leaderboard - our task is much harder.\n",
    "Unfortunately this does slow down the training, because we have to\n",
    "render all the frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strictly speaking, we will present the state as the difference between\n",
    "the current screen patch and the previous one. This will allow the agent\n",
    "to take the velocity of the pole into account from one image.\n",
    "\n",
